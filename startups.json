This allows the operator to focus on the work at hand rather than directly navigating the unmanned vessel. The technological advantage is the hybrid technology with smart software algorithm engines/hardware for both manned & unmanned operations. This can be configured to suit the particular vehicle & is not restricted to vehicle type. The technology is equally suited to controlling a torpedo shaped body & also a high-speed boat. It uses self- tuning algorithms, which it learns from the vehicle responses & adapts itself to it. It can be used as a simple autopilot to a high end stand-alone unmanned system. The technology is being used in survey, security & military applications. This autonomous system is modular and application adaptive & thus can be retro-fitted easily onto any vessel irrespective of its type, size, shape, application & propulsion.AI allows us to better understand big data. So as the technology learns & collects data, it will bring understanding of the ocean. With autonomous ship development, the question remains of what would be done with the existing ship tonnage & safety of human lives. This is where SDE developed a system that could be retrofitted upon a regular vessel & give it all the capabilities of an intelligent vessel & the ability to execute repetitive missions without human intervention."

This will make it an asset for the farmers and they’ll earn from it, rather than burning it. To add value to this rice straw, Kriya Labs has developed a pulping technology, which converts straw into pulp, which can further be converted into several marketable products such as disposable tablewares, brown paper, rigid board packaging and molded pulp packaging.",

This feature will help us go into a decentralised model of business, where high volume-low density rice straw will cover shorter transportation paths and low volume-high density pulp can be directed to farther mainstream markets. This way, we will be able to establish a chain of small scale pulping units, which will collect the rice straw from nearby farms, convert it into pulp products and then distribute it to suitable markets."

Water tank of fire tender having capacity of apprx. 3600 liters emptied out in 2 minutes with pump of 1800 LPM discharge capacity whereas with same amount of water i.e. 3600 liters, Motorbike fire engine would continue to sanitize the area for 360 minutes (06 hours). Hence, wastage of water can be controlled and after effect of using large amount of water i.e. salvation can also be minimized. Psychologically, motorbike helps administration to continuously sanitize the area and control the public from getting panicked due to non availability of water in Fire Tender in their area for spraying disinfectant. Single tab, bucket can be used to fill water tanks of Motorbike and thereby addition of disinfectant for continuous sanitization operation unlike Fire Tenders where large quantity of water emptied out in few minutes and again sent for filing at designated locations, therefore continuous sanitization operation could not be possible . Moreover, our bike is eco-friendly, economic and operates with minimal costs. Operation time is around 5 minutes with single filling and with a supply of water locally, it can be operated continuously for hours which is very beneficial for combating virus effect. This technology enables the motorbike to produce high pressure water mist through a Pump-PTO system and make it capable for Firefighters to extinguish all classes of fire (A,B and C), Wood, paper, plastic, cloth, furniture, fuel- petrol, diesel, gas and electrical fire as well."

Conventionally, Pectin is produced from Citrus peel (85%) and apple pomace (14%) which are the by-products of juicing plants. However, in the absence of large juicing plants in India, availability of these raw materials is limited. As a result, over 95% of India’s requirement of Pectin, estimated at 1,500 MT per year and growing at a CAGR of 18% annually, is imported. Their aim is to utilize the large quantities of mango peel available in India to produce Pectin on a commercial scale.",

In India, more than 80% deliveries conducted in low resource healthcare settings which lack of skilled healthcare workers and medical devices. During intrapartum period, fetal heart rate and uterine contraction monitoring is really important to know the status of the mother and fetus, but monitored inaccurately and ignored more than 85% of the time. This leads to mortality/morbidity in case of any anomaly. Existing device cardiotocography is high cost (>3000 USD), non-portable (5 Kg) and required skilled healthcare worker for continuous monitoring of FHR & uterine contraction displays both the parameters in a graphical format. In current practice, gynaecologist analyzes the pattern of fetal heart rate & uterine contraction on printed CTG graph to recognize the fetus distress. Based on that, they take early decision to prevent any mortality or morbidity. WHO Partograph is designed to monitor & make timely interventions to prevent complications during the intrapartum period. More than 90% of the midwives fill the partograph after delivery, that too for the data recording formality."

With the thread-like structures at the microscopic level, StopBleed acts 5X faster than its competitors, proven. The powdered form gives it a high degree of flexibility and can be used in any severity, size, and shape of the wound. Additionally, this product has wound healing capability-tested. The same production process can be used to develop more products in the same line with different compositions-tested by developing another product InstaBrin. Currently, for stopping bleeding people rely on surgical gauzes and manual pressure. And for wound healing they use different kind of anti-bacterial or anti-inflammatory agents. But now StopBleed has all these properties-it will stop bleeding, prevent from bacterial infections and will heal the wounds as well.

Modified Electrolyte to impede growth of Dendrite, and 3. Use Ceramic coating on Anode side of Separator, to provide higher resistance for Dendrite to penetrate separator and short with Cathode. All the above partial mitigating mechanisms. Uniqueness about our Technology is, it does not allow Lithium metal deposition on the anode surface.

Yet, it is not reliable as conductivity can change with respect to herds, feed, water intake, climatic condition, pregnancy and lactation period. Hence, it is difficult to set up a cut off value to detect mastitis. Hence, we have developed Quadmastest, 1) This is the first mastitis detection device that shows the variation in the conductivity between teat to teat irrespective of the breed nature 2. The device can be maintained at all temperatures and this does not rely on any physical, chemical or biological reagents. 3. This is an ergonomic design and it weighs just 400 gm and hence it is easily portable. Further, this is a POC device, does not require any lab set up to diagnose the infection 4. This is water-proof, can be easily washed before and after use.  Our Quadmastest device will be a make in India product - an import substitution product that effectively can replace the need for imported expensive kits which can 200Rs/assay to 45000Rs per device. And Mastitis management sector is a 15 Billion-dollar/year market and is expected to grow at 5.2% CAGR as of 2019.

For enterprises, data security and data isolation are some of the biggest challenges when dealing with 3rd party platforms. Locobuzz follows a multi-tenant architecture that enables us to keep each client?s data separate from other clients. Locobuzz undergoes a vulnerability assessment and penetration tests every 6 months through a leading 3rd party security firm in India to harden the security and proactively plug any vulnerabilities if found. To achieve this, Locobuzz has built a scalable architecture that automatically scales to cater to higher data volume and self-corrects itself in case any anomaly arrives. We process millions of data points in near real-time every day and enrich them via different micro-services. The enrichment micro-services are plug-and-play services that can be hot pulled or pushed into the system without hampering the working of the system. Locobuzz recognizes the role of machine learning and is investing heavily in it. In its product roadmap, a lot of features are based on machine learning which is currently non-existent in this domain."

Gene editing technology also causes therapy hesitation among patients thereby discouraging the use of gene-editing technology. Our drug-delivery vehicle will have a multi-pronged beneficial effect whereby first it will reduce the toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs by 30%, secondly, as the drugs will be specifically targeted to the tumor cells it will also reduce the effective drug concentration by 400 times than what is required to achieve a similar reduction in tumor volume by the free drug, thus reducing the treatment cost as well as physical and psychological effect on the patients, third as exosomes are clathrin-coated they are very stable thus increasing their longevity after infusion, fourth as our ExoDS platform will target cancer stem cells, it will increase the post-treatment relapse-free survival (RFS) period."
